As a postgraduate student, my experience with Intellect Circle Symposium has been nothing short of transformative. Their commitment to fostering intellectual growth and promoting meaningful discourse has allowed me to expand my knowledge horizons and engage in stimulating discussions that extend beyond the classroom. The organization's emphasis on both current affairs and emerging technologies has not only broadened my understanding of the world but has also equipped me with the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate complex issues in today's rapidly evolving landscape. I've found a welcoming community of like-minded young intellectuals who share a passion for making a positive impact, and this platform has allowed me to harness my potential as a change-maker in a diverse and inclusive environment. Intellect Circle Symposium is truly a beacon for postgraduate students like me, offering a space where curiosity and innovation thrive, and where we can collectively shape a brighter future.

I was introduced to ICS through a collegue of mine as a teamate to one of his projects. 
PPLAs I started to indulge more in their webinars, I met more like-minded people and learned about
 new ideas i could use to develop myself and my preneurship.
 I recommend this platform as it helped me increase my soft skills and network with people
 who share the same objective as mine.
As a source for an interactive platform to increase exposure and network,
 this is the right place for all of it.

As a female entrepreneur, first year graduate and head of welfare club, ICS has helped me navigate my interest and potential in so many different areas.
 Starting as a student participant, I achieved my dream of starting my own initiative for waste management. As a student, the members of ICS not only
 gave their ear ear when I felt discouraged, but also gave me some key insights and resources to ensure my success.
